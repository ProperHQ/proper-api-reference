title: Authentication
---

Proper uses [API keys](/apikeys) to authenticate requests. You can view and manage your API keys in the [Proper platform](https://app.helloproper.com).

Your API keys carry many privileges, so be sure to keep them secure! Do not share your secret API keys in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, and so forth.

All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over plain HTTP will fail. API requests without authentication will also fail.

```bash Authenticated request
curl --request GET \
  --url https://api.helloproper.com/bills \
  --header 'Authorization: your_secret_key
```
