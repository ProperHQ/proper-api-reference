title: "Pagination"
---

Properâ€™s API methods use cursor-based pagination through the `starting_after` and `ending_before` parameters. Both parameters accept an existing object ID value and return objects in reverse chronological order.
The `ending_before` parameter returns objects listed before the named object. The `starting_after` parameter returns objects listed after the named object. These parameters are mutually exclusive. You can use either the `starting_after` or `ending_before` parameter, but not both simultaneously.

### Params

<ParamField query="limit" type="number" default={100}>
  This specifies a limit on the number of objects to return, ranging between 1 and 100.
</ParamField>

<ParamField query="starting_after" type="string">
  A cursor to use in pagination. `starting_after` is an object ID that defines your place in the list. For example, if you make a list request and receive 100 objects, ending with `obj_propster`, your subsequent call can include `starting_after=obj_propster` to fetch the next page of the list.
</ParamField>

<ParamField query="starting_after" type="string">
  A cursor to use in pagination. `ending_before` is an object ID that defines your place in the list. For example, if you make a list request and receive 100 objects, starting with `obj_propster`, your subsequent call can include `ending_before=obj_propster` to fetch the previous page of the list.
