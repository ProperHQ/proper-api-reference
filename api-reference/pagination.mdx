title: "Pagination"
---

Properâ€™s API methods use cursor-based pagination through the `startingAfter` parameter. It accepts an existing object ID value and return objects in the specific resource order.
The `starting_after` parameter returns objects listed after the named object.

### Params

<ParamField query="limit" type="number" default={10}>
  This specifies a limit on the number of objects to return, ranging between 1 and 100.
</ParamField>

<ParamField query="startingAfter" type="string">
  A cursor to use in pagination. `startingAfter` is an object ID that defines your place in the list. For example, if you make a list request and receive 100 objects, ending with `obj_propster`, your subsequent call can include `starting_after=obj_propster` to fetch the next page of the list.
</ParamField>

{/* <ParamField query="endingBefore" type="string">
  A cursor to use in pagination. `endingBefore` is an object ID that defines your place in the list. For example, if you make a list request and receive 100 objects, starting with `obj_propster`, your subsequent call can include `ending_before=obj_propster` to fetch the previous page of the list.
</ParamField> */}
